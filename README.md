# Arista EOS for Visual Studio Code

This extension to Visual Studio code provides syntax highlighting for Arista EOS configurations.  Eventually I hope add additional refactoring, navigation and linting features.

## Features

* Syntax highlighting of EOS configurations
* Code block folding of subconfiguration elements such as ACL rules and routing configurations

## Ideas to implement

* [ ] Jump to definition to jump from access-group to access-list definition
* [ ] Basic linting
* [ ] Pull live configs from device
* [ ] Push configs to device
* [ ] Jinja generation

## Known Issues

## Release Notes

Currently only syntax highlighting

### 0.1.0

Initial release
